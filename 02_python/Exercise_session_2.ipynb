    "Suppose that we flip a fair coin $n$ times to obtain $n$ random bits.\n",
    "  Consider all $m= \\binom{n}{2}$ pairs of these bits and order them in some way.\n",
    "  Let $Y_{i}$ the ex-or of the $i$th pair of bits and let $Y=\\sum_{i=1}^{m} Y_{i}$\n",

    "Next we argue that they are not mutually independent. We could look at an example or we could just extend the notation slighlty. Let's change the notation to $Y_{ij} = \\text{XOR}[X_i,X_j]$ and study the three variables $Y_{ij}$, $Y_{jk}$, $Y_{ik}$ that are based on the three variables $X_i$, $X_j$, $X_k$. Suppose we know that\n",

Each of these events have probability $0.5^3$ and thus $\\Pr[Y_{ij} Y_{jk} = 1] = 2 \\cdot 0.5^3 = 0.25$. Since the only possible outcomes for $Y_{ij} Y_{jk}$ are $1$ and $0$ we thus get\n",
